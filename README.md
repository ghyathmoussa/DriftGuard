# ML Model Drift and Performance Monitoring

This project will be build as open source project, I will write the main steps over here

# Overview

The tool will:

- Monitor data drift (changes in input data distribution).

- Monitor concept drift (changes in the relationship between input and output).

- Track model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).

- Provide visualizations and alerts for anomalies.

- Be modular, extensible, and easy to integrate into existing ML pipelines.

# Key Features

- Data Drift Detection:

    Statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Chi-Square, Wasserstein distance).

    Feature-wise distribution comparison.

- Concept Drift Detection:

    Monitor model predictions vs. actual labels over time.

    Use methods like ADWIN, DDM (Drift Detection Method), or Page-Hinkley.

- Performance Monitoring:

    Track key metrics over time.

    Compare training vs. production performance.

- Visualization:

    Dashboards for drift and performance metrics.

    Time-series plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

- Alerting:

    Send alerts via email, Slack, or other channels when drift or performance degradation is detected.

- Storage:

    Log metrics and drift statistics for historical analysis.
